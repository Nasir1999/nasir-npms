# nasir-npms
This repository is created and maintained by ```Nasir Baloch```. I am just a student of bachelor. And i have very little knowledge about the things. Any kind of suggestions and teachings will be highly appreciated.

In this repository i will be continously updating my npm packages. Although some of these packages will be very small. But the main logic behind these short/small packages is to avoid the extra lines of codes and make your code cleaner and optimized.

1. [Shuffler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nasirbaloch/shuffler). This is the package for any kind of array shuffle and after shuffle it will provide you an random item of that array.
2. [Copy-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nasirbaloch/copy-lite). This is a very light weighted copier. You can pass any thing, it will be simply copy to clipboard.

Please correct me if i have done anything in a wrong way. Thanks üòç‚úå ```#happyCoding #avoidExtraLines```
